since we last spoke sadly and one thing

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.680
I wanted to talk to you about today this

and I know you've talked about this but

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.480
I want to get into it today um which is

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.519
religion the role of religion in this

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.319
conflict okay the role of religious

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.239
extremism something you and I have both

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.840
critiqued in our own ways over the years

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.840
both within our own community and in

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.879
other communities but I want to start

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.480
with a really crazy story that you've

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.239
talked about um I didn't believe when I

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.879
came across I thought this is nonsense

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.080
what what are we talking about I'm

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.000
talking about a cow no are you talking

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.280
about the red heers I want to talk about

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.200
red heers I know dude no I I need to

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.319
talk to you about red heers no I do I'm

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.480
I've become obsessed with red heers no I

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.519
have I'm like the expert on red heers

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.239
now here's here's the thing about Tre

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.120
heers I went on a couple of podcasts and

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.760
everybody was like oh Basim now is

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.959
meddling in conspiracy theories so with

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.040
all of that these messages like okay

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.840
maybe I went too far because honestly I

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.840
was watching a lot lot of stuff like for

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.000
example that documentary called praying

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.360
for Armageddon which is an incredible uh

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.840
documentary I think done by a Danish uh

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.159
director and they came to my show by the

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.000
way in Copenhagen and and and and they

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.560
were very appreciative but I thought I

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.798
was going too far because I was scared

00:04:17.798 --> 00:04:20.399
because when I saw that the people high

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:24.280
up politicians people in power talking

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.759
spouting crazy religious uh

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.639
apocalyptic ideas I thought I was a

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.280
little bit paranoid well well just just

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.759
so just so our viewers and listeners are

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.199
with us what's the deal with the red

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.840
heers I I I don't all right I'll tell

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.600
you I'll I don't want to get into it all

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.400
I'm gonna get into it okay this is I

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.720
hear the thing he's a respectful

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.560
journalist so I'm goingon to hide behind

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.840
his journalistic credibility and I'm

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.600
going to see oh my God is that true oh

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.479
my God is this happening people who know

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:54.800
me know that even if you disagree with

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.320
me I try and bring receipt for those

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.880
bring the receipts for those of you at

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.840
home who aren't aware of what is going

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.280
on in a what was a fringe part of the

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.680
Israeli Jewish Community but is becoming

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.240
very mainstream unfortunately under this

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.880
government there are a bunch of

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.919
Messianic people in Israel who want to

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.919
build the Third Temple right there's two

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.360
previous temples destroyed by the Romans

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.600
the last one 70 AD and right now there

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.720
is a movement a temple movement in

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.039
Israel and supported abroad that wants

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.280
to rebuild the Temple the only slight

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.759
problem is they want to rebuild it on

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:28.319
top of alaka which is one of the holiest

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.400
sites for Muslims in j are you saying

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.280
that those people are using religious

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.080
ideas in order to push political agendas

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.960
so they can bring back thought only

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.840
Muslims do that they can bring back no

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.280
they can't because they're not Muslim

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.880
Jesus and the end of the world no I

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.160
thought we are the only one we The Crazy

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.600
Ones no don't tell me I do not believe

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.759
you I do not believe you no no no no no

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.720
no you've jumped ahead my friend because

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.880
we haven't even got to Jesus yet we're

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.000
talking about our Jewish cousins let's

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.880
wait till we get to our Christian

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.080
cousins in a moment well both of them

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.520
are waiting for some kind of so they

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.720
wait Muslims are waiting too for the for

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.160
a guy do you know who the Muslims are

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.440
yeah not me but also Jesus but also

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.199
Jesus Jesus has to come before M before

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:07.479
we get into the deep religion this is

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:08.960
not a religious discussion maybe it's I

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.039
want to be clear we neither of us are

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.039
religious Scholars you are the

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.759
Antichrist neither of us are religious

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.680
Scholars but this is important because

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.360
right now we seeing a lot of violence

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.080
not just in Gaza as you pointed out in

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.039
your initial viral PE Morgan appearance

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.240
West Bank occupied West Bank East J SE a

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.759
lot of violence and a lot of that is to

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.520
do with these Messianic folks trying to

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.000
storm the Ala compound trying to get you

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.360
know sovereignty of the Temple Mount and

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.880
just what's fascinating is there's a

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.000
bunch of cows at the heart of this and

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.280
you talk about we don't need to hide

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.479
behind me well let's hide behind CBS

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.479
News let's hide behind CBS News in a

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.720
recent speech a Hamas spokesman blamed

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.360
the Jews for bringing red cows to the

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.120
Holy Land the cows he's talking about at

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.720
a secure undisclosed location are these

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.800
red heers to be precise some Jews and

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.400
Christians believe they're the key to

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.800
rebuilding the historic Jewish temple in

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.080
Jerusalem and to beckoning the Messiah

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.680
so just to be clear to the viewers and

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.440
listeners at home I just want to be

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.400
clear about this there is a belief in

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.680
some Jewish

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.680
circles that in order to rebuild the

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.720
Temple the Third Temple because there

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.160
was a first and a second temple they

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.680
believe the second destroyed by the

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.120
Romans in 70 AD in order to do that now

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.440
before the Messiah gets here part of the

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.319
uh buildup to that is finding a red heer

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:32.240
a female cow that's never been milked

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.479
never been pregnant never worked never

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:37.879
been yolked to a cart and that cow has

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:40.400
to be completely red not even two hairs

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.560
can be non- red otherwise doesn't count

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.720
very hard to find and that cow has to be

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.639
found brought to Jerusalem burned

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.680
overlooking the site of the Temple mount

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.400
the Mount of Olives is one such site and

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.599
when they burn that cow they look at the

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.000
Book of Numbers in the Old Testament

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.919
which talks about this prophecy well it

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:00.800
talks about the use of a cow to purify

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.520
the priests this is what Moses and his

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.319
brother Aaron are told by the Lord in

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:06.800
the Book of Numbers they believe that in

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.560
order to burn this cow they're then

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.039
purifying the ground purifying the holy

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:12.720
space purifying the priests who will

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.919
come and build the Third Temple that's

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:18.840
the role that the red heer plays and

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.440
they now say they've got five of them

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.879
they claimed they were going to burn it

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:24.199
on Passover didn't happened Passover

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:25.440
came and went they said they're going to

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.879
do it on Pentecost According to some of

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:29.000
the evangelicals that's come and gone in

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.199
May didn't happen now they're saying

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:33.640
maybe June in shavo like with a lot of

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.679
religious cults the date keeps moving

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.958
but I find it fascinating that these

00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.080
people are using this idea of

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.760
sacrificing a cow to rebuild the Temple

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.719
to bring about basically their version

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:45.959
of the end times but forget end times we

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:46.839
all know what would happen

00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:48.279
geopolitically in the world we live in

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:50.360
today if there was God forbidden attack

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.160
on alaka mamos by crazy Messianic also

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.800
on plan based so I don't know I don't I

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.680
don't sub to I'm I'm almost vegan so

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.920
well I actually love a good steak I love

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.160
beef um so it's interesting let's have

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.160
some beef by the way here's the

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.440
interesting part to the story of the red

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.680
heers yeah the people who brought over

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.000
these cows they've been trying to breed

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.040
one of these red heers for ages in the

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.200
West Bank in the mid90s apparently there

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.000
was a cow called Melody that they

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.480
thought was the cow and by the way for

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.480
people thinking we're crazy again let's

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.440
hide behind someone else David land of

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.040
haret wrote a piece in the mid90s and he

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.160
said shoot the cow in the head a Bullet

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.760
to the Head we cannot have this cow it

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.519
will bring about it'll bring about

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:29.560
craziness it'll bring about a terrorist

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.120
attack right that's how worried people

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.320
were in Israeli Society about The Fringe

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.880
but in the '90s they were The Fringe bam

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.279
now they're in government they're in

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:38.360
cabinet the Israeli government gave a

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.160
exception to these cows do you know this

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.000
they turned them into pets pets pets

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.279
they say like we cannot bring them

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:47.040
because they are strict laws to Bringing

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.079
cattle outside of Israel so they had to

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:51.720
bring them as pets pets and they were

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.399
greeted at the airport by the Israeli

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.720
Minister the director general of the

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.000
Israeli Ministry for Jerusalem and

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.320
Heritage of Faith the Israeli government

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.000
is in on this is not some this is why

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
this is why we want to talk about it

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.480
today because I talk a lot about the

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.079
Israeli government about benav about

00:10:03.079 --> 00:10:05.680
smotrich about eliahu who's the Heritage

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.040
Minister from sm's party the about the

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.200
temple Institute which is actually an

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.160
Institute supported by the Israeli

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.720
government so here's the thing this is

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.839
exactly what happened to me when I

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:16.640
started talking about this like bassim

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.360
is just bringing Fringe ideas these are

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.680
people in The Fringe and people were

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.000
responding to me it's like oh you're

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.440
just like bringing the most extreme

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.959
ideas like okay maybe I'm wrong but now

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.519
I see some of those people in ceremonies

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:31.279
like for example when they open the move

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:34.480
the the American Embassy into Jerusalem

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.639
all of those like John haggy all of

00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:39.279
those uh right wi all all the people

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:41.560
came in and they were celebrating it so

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.120
it is not really just political it is

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.959
religious and that is scary here's the

00:10:45.959 --> 00:10:48.240
thing about um building the Third Temple

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.200
over aamas a lot of people when they see

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.519
this picture of the gold Dome mosque

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:56.360
they say that's the that's actually the

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.040
the the the rock of the Dome of the Rock

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.800
yeah El oxos is actually right next to

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.839
it h and it's like a a rectangular like

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:10.160
yellowish building and uh I remember I

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.040
was growing up people say like be

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.560
careful this is not a oxos that's aamos

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.279
because with all of the conspiracy

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:17.680
theories at the time we thought it was

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.360
Fringe it will never happen but now it's

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.000
closer than ever it's like when they

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
build when they tear down the oxam was

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.079
like see the the the the golden dome is

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.000
still there we didn't tear it down so

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.399
maybe it's just like to for especially

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.680
for the people who are not from that to

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.959
understand the distinction between AOS

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:38.240
and either ways even if there's no axos

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.680
to have like to go in and and to do

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.480
something that will

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.279
incite maybe a very a very very big

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:47.440
Regional War just because of religious

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.279
uh beliefs that's that's that's scary in

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:51.839
itself so I want to bring up those guys

00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:53.839
you mentioned in a moment before we get

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:56.040
that far let's just talk about what's so

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.160
fascinating is there is this weird

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.639
Alliance between right-wing Christian

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:03.279
evangelicals in the US who want to bring

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:05.200
about the new Temple because Jesus Will

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.680
Rule from that Temple for a thousand

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.000
years they believe the

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.079
dispensationalist and of course our our

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:11.800
far-right Israeli settler friends who

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.760
want to uh you know destroy all of this

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.199
and and bring back the Messiah I should

00:12:15.199 --> 00:12:17.639
point out mainstream Jewish religious

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:19.639
views is that the temple is rebuilt when

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.800
the Messiah comes not predates it you

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.880
can't f it it reminds me actually and

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.120
people get upset with this analogy but

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.920
it reminds of some of the Isis folks do

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.040
you remember some of the Isis folks in

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.399
dbek wanted a big b to bring about the

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:32.560
end of the world they belied in Northern

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.720
Syria and most of us Muslims said that's

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.320
not how it works you don't get to kind

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.480
of accelerate the end of the world

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.120
through your own stupid actions so

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.399
actually this comes back to the origin

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:44.240
of the Zionist movement because when the

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.839
Zionist movement started in the 19th

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:47.880
century and they said like we need to

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.600
have an Israel an Israel a state of

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.880
Israel so we will bring back the the

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.279
Messiah many of the rabis said like no

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.959
you can't he has to come first so they

00:12:57.959 --> 00:13:00.800
said well we got accelerate it so we

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.240
going basically we're going to build it

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.199
and he will come yes that most religious

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:05.639
Jews and rabbis around the start of

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:07.279
Zionism were poster Zionism precisely

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:08.880
this reason as a secular ideology and

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.160
I'm going to be debating Zionism next

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.399
month in June in Toronto on this very

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:14.760
subject because people don't understand

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.480
the history of this topic it is very

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.000
political right now you have government

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.360
ministers in Israel supporting this

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.079
stuff you have a temple Institute that

00:13:21.079 --> 00:13:23.240
wants to do it and by the way Hamas keep

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.440
bringing this up we want to talk about

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.639
they always want us to talk about Hamas

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:27.079
B let's talk about Hamas before talking

00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:28.199
about Hamas I want to talk about

00:13:28.199 --> 00:13:29.959
something about religious about like

00:13:29.959 --> 00:13:31.800
when we're talking about like a lot of

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.160
uh uh rabbis and Jewish sex were against

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.440
having uh Palestine as as the the the

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.279
state for like to to be the home for for

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:43.680
Jewish people uh there was this

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.639
documentary uh produced directed and

00:13:46.639 --> 00:13:50.199
hosted by Bill Mars called religious

00:13:50.199 --> 00:13:53.240
L dumb name religious list is that the

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.040
name going off to making the case for

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.639
atheism right yeah yeah but no no he was

00:13:56.639 --> 00:14:00.199
making fun of of of organized religions

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:04.199
Islam Christianity Judaism so in that he

00:14:04.199 --> 00:14:07.199
made fun of all of the extreme views of

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.240
all of the religions he went to Islam

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.720
and of course it was like an easy target

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.600
for him all of the people Killing In The

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.040
Name Of of Allah all of those people

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.440
like using terrorism as a way to advance

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.839
the religious beliefs okay and then he

00:14:19.839 --> 00:14:21.839
went to the Christians and he made fun

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:23.279
of the second coming of Jesus and the

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.399
Rapture but then he went to the Jewish

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:29.160
people he had a lot to choose from but

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.839
what he did he went to NRI Carta which

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:36.000
is an the anti Zionist who uh who are

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.440
against having Israel as a state until

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.240
the M pry extreme views we should say as

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.079
well but here's the thing when he went

00:14:43.079 --> 00:14:45.480
to the Judaism because like Bill Mark

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.120
just like I'm an equal opportunity

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.040
offender I make go after the powerful he

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.440
didn't go he didn't go after the PE the

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.560
extreme people in Israel who says that

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.959
all the Gentiles will be our slaves or

00:14:56.959 --> 00:14:58.480
everybody will be enslaved by the Jews

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.360
and they will be happy that is a fringe

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.279
position within Judaism but The Fringe

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:03.839
has been empowered in Israel I know but

00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:05.440
you see what he did he went after The

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.320
Fringe in all of the other religions and

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.680
he when he went after after the the the

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.000
fren Jew people he went under after

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.360
something that would serve a political

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.720
purpose so interesting is as as a Muslim

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.519
who covered the war on terror you know I

00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:20.160
was asked again and again to answer for

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.880
isis's apocalyptic views and isis's end

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.360
time and I say these people are fringed

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.800
these people are not representative of

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.120
any average Muslim and today I want to

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.160
say the same thing about my Jewish

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.880
cousins most American Jews don't support

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.920
this stuff but what's interesting is

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.720
again I'll say it again Israeli

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.120
government contains these ministers

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.279
Israeli government supports the group

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:40.440
that's bringing in heers as pets in

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.720
order to burn them at the Mount of

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.240
Olives and bring about the new Temple

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.959
and the end of time and here's the thing

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:49.240
growing up I was always faced by my

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.199
American friends bringing me videos that

00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:54.800
would always bring the worst of of of

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.680
The Fringe of the Muslim world and it's

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.000
like oh look at this saying this like

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.839
doesn't represent me and I was put in a

00:16:00.839 --> 00:16:03.120
position having to defend myself so you

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.639
know what I am grateful that for the

00:16:04.639 --> 00:16:06.959
first time now people like wait a minute

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:08.519
it's not just Islam it's not that

00:16:08.519 --> 00:16:09.959
Christianity why aren't everybody

00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:12.399
talking about The Fringe in the

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:15.279
Jewish religion who are actually now not

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:17.240
just like a fringe but they are leading

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.279
their political Direction no but what's

00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:19.639
so scary and this is what I want to talk

00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:20.639
to you about today this is about

00:16:20.639 --> 00:16:21.800
politics this is not a religious

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.000
discussion CH you and I not religious

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.639
Scholars what I would say is the

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:27.000
politics of this is super scary so right

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.680
now you have Christian evangelicals in

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.480
the us who want to bring about the end

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.399
of times with the cows everyone needs to

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:35.000
see this national gathering for pray and

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.040

occupied West Bank listen to the stuff

00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:11.799
that they are saying so my friend Rabbi

we need to find the red heer he said we

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.919
need to look into numbers 19 and we need

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:22.079
to do what the what the Lord said what

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.480
God Said and so that's what we did so

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.559
saki can you tell us about numbers 19

00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:28.439
and what that means you know it's a

00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:30.760
strange Commandment that actually more

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.480
than 2,000 years nobody uh deal with and

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.679
uh when we start to make a research we

00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:40.520
found that there is a red angos if you

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.919
are a farmer from Kansas Texas you will

00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:47.360
know exactly what is this and uh I

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.720
called my friend Byron and I told him

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.200
listen we're looking for red as it's

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.039
written in the Bible numbers 19 uh you

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:59.520
have to find a red heer without

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:04.679
blemish without white or black hair that

00:18:04.679 --> 00:18:05.720
never

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.400
walk and let bring it to Jerusalem not

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.240
as a sa sacrifice the red heer is not

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.880
sacrifice the red heer is a

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.320
ceremony we use the red he we burn it

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.360
together with ESOP and other things and

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.640
then mix the Ash with water from the

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.760
spring and then we can be to be

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.840
I mean like I did not leave the Middle

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.360
East escaping from dictatorships and and

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.200
religious extremism Texas to come here

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.320
to be ruled by a bunch of peasants from

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.280
Texas with extreme religious view

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.919
putting what what we are going to get

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:50.600
the red haers we are going to slaughter

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.400
them burn them and then mix but it's not

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.159
a

00:18:54.159 --> 00:18:56.200
sacrifice I just wanted to make this

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.799
clear we're going to take those animals

00:18:58.799 --> 00:18:59.919
slaughter

00:18:59.919 --> 00:19:03.840
them burn turn them into ashes but it's

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.520
not sacrifice it's a ceremony I cannot

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.720
find better better like gas lighting

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.039
techniques like this my my my my wife's

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:13.280

steak in Texas again Red Angus without

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.000
thinking about without thinking about

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.559
the end of times let me say this wait

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:20.320
wait can you please go back like look

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.400

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.159
this this this is this is sorcery sorry

00:19:39.159 --> 00:19:40.679
sorry B this is sorcery this is where

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:41.960
we're going to disagree you and I no

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.840
this ISE with you this is sorcery no

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.039
it's religious scripture the Quran has

00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:47.360
I'm going to defend religious scripture

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.440
I don't have a problem with religious

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.679
scripture I have a problem with

00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:52.480
religious scripture being politicized I

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.520
a to se land I have a problem with is

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.080
going to be as it's going to affect

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.280
someone who doesn't believe in that

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.240
scripture that's true you have Hamas

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.360
putting out statements people don't

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.400
realize this Hamas have put out

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.679
statements saying we did the alaka flood

00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:05.760
that's what they call their attack cuz

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.799
they think they're protecting alaa

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:09.240
because red cows were brought in for

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.679
Americans Hamas are following the red

00:20:10.679 --> 00:20:12.720
hea story which is insane so you have

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.400
Hamas stupidly claiming that they killed

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.640
innocent people because they worried

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.880
about red cows you have two guys a

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.080
Jewish and a Christian guy at a

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.480
conference opened by the house speaker

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.240
in January three months after October

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.280
7th saying this is what we're trying to

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.840
physically bring about can you imagine

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.039
if Nancy Pelosi when she was house

00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:29.679
speaking T about Muslim conference where

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:31.080
they talked about end of the world can

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.480
you imagine the reaction in our media

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.960
nobody would have been saying conspiracy

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.280
that they' have been saying you're

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.520
empowering extremists and what is what's

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.640
so fascinating about these two guys is

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.200
they want different things from the same

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.880
scripture yes this is what's so

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.640
fascinating to me I say to my Jewish

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.039
friends all the time and I say to

00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:47.799
Israelis even who disagree with me we

00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:49.200
can disagree but why are you allying

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.960
with those guys those guys want you dead

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.320
like the end of let's explain that

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.520
because because everybody talks about

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.880
judeo-christian Val there is nothing

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.679
judeo-christian here because from

00:21:00.679 --> 00:21:04.200
the from the from the uh right-wing

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.640
extreme Christian point of view they

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.520
would say that uh the second coming of

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.720
Jesus will happen Rapture will happen

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.720
and he's going to come and every single

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.600
Jew will either convert or die except

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.480
144,000 Jews who would be uh who would

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.440
uh preach the gospel of Christ on the

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.480
other hand on the other hand of the

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.000
extreme Jewish side they say that it's

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.240
actually

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.480
when when when the mesiah come because

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.880
it's not they don't

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.520
theologies everybody will be enslaved by

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.760
the Jews including Christians and both

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.520
of these are extreme positions within

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.440
Christianity and Judaism just like we

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.080
have extreme they basically pushing for

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.679
something for the same thing but to

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:46.279
totally different outcome Israeli

00:21:46.279 --> 00:21:48.440
leaders have been asked in the past B

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.679
why are you allying with these nut jobs

00:21:50.679 --> 00:21:52.120
who basically their vision of supporting

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.480
Israel is basically we want everyone in

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.880
gathered there so that Jesus come back

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.240
and everyone dies and they say we'll

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.840
take whatever allies we can get right

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.720
that's the cynical move on the Israeli

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.159
far right is to Ally with actual

00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:04.039
anti-semites Al also speaking about

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:06.880
using religion and politics I remember

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.200
you had a very interesting interview

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.840
with naftali B by the way I quoted this

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.720
that interview in another part when

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.440
everybody where does Israel has the

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.000
right to exist and then I told him like

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.880
na benett was Al jaer a couple of years

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.000
ago and he was asked about the

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.520
Palestinians right to exist like well

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.520
not everybody gets a country like the

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.120
people in the bass people in Cur don't

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.000
have a country so pal and then but when

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.480
it comes to Israel oh okay of course

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.240
well because of Hees religious reasoning

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.720
yeah but then but then in the same

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.279
interview I guess you actually asked him

00:22:35.279 --> 00:22:39.000
a very interesting question about that

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.960
let me finish and he never finishes he

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.039
never answers what's so fascinating and

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:45.200
I do miss my suit and tie as I watched

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.080
that clip and I miss my lack of gray

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.480
hair back in the day but are you hear me

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.600
there going is this a theocracy what is

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.400
going on here like but he deflects but

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.760
I've interviewed so many people over the

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.520
years I've interviewed ilhan Omar hate

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.000
figure for the American right they've

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.559
never I've interviewed Palestinians from

00:22:59.559 --> 00:23:00.960
every fact they've never even the Hamas

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.080
guys I've interviewed I've never quoted

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.679
the Quran to me like no one's had the

00:23:03.679 --> 00:23:05.760
audacity to come on a TV show and say to

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.360
me well Bible verse XY Quran verse XY

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.960
this guy's telling me the he goes on to

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.200
become Prime Minister of Israel shortly

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.279
after this interview he's telling me go

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:16.279
change the Bible and you he I was

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:17.600
perplexed in that moment I was like is

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.600
he really doing this and that's why we

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.720
need to understand that there are people

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.080
who are you know we talk about in our

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.760
community the salafi literalists the

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.279
people who take the word the Quran and

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:28.640
Hadith literally these guys are running

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.600
Israel some of these people and Israelis

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.679
know this by the way we don't talk about

00:23:31.679 --> 00:23:33.559
this in American Media Israeli secular

00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:34.559
Israelis know that their country is

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:36.000
being overrun the New York Times just

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.400
did a big piece about how Fringe

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.799
settlers and Messianic figures have

00:23:39.799 --> 00:23:41.200
basically taken over Israel Ronan

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.760
burkeman has just written a piece last

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.880
week so this is a conversation we need

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.840
to have it has impact on all of us and

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.320
meanwhile instead of calling this stuff

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.039
out the American political mainstream

00:23:52.039 --> 00:23:53.919
especially the Republican party you have

00:23:53.919 --> 00:23:56.480
Mike Johnson turning up uh to events

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.039
where they're talking about red heers

00:23:58.039 --> 00:23:59.520
and and you know building another Temple

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.200
and bringing about the end of the world

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.120
you mentioned them all the John hagges

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.720
the religious Christian Evangelical

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.440
leadership in this country who are

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.679
totally on board with isra and also

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:09.880
people like kufi Christian United for

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.559
Israel they have an annual budget of $7

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:16.000
million to spend on lobbying $7 million

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.919
and and actually over the years John

00:24:17.919 --> 00:24:20.840
haggi sent $80 million to Israel not

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.600
from his own money but these are all

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.360
donations from his congregation so you

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.559
know how he gets the donations let's

00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:26.919
we've got a clip of John haggy let's

00:24:26.919 --> 00:24:29.200
play the clip of John hegy Jewish people

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.000
are a covenant people those covenants

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.080
that God made with them still stand they

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.840
have not been replaced by the church as

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.399
many of you have been taught the Jewish

00:24:40.399 --> 00:24:43.279
people are a cherished people they are a

00:24:43.279 --> 00:24:46.279
chosen people God chose those people I

00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:48.080
am I I need to talk about God chosen

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.320
people okay because I I don't know as a

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.000
Christian when when when when your

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.640
priests or Pastor tells you there are

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.080
God chosen people now if I'm sitting

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.240
there why am I not one of them like I

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.960
mean would I feel like left out why why

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.960
isn't God chosen me I mean if you

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.279
believe so hard that these are God

00:25:08.279 --> 00:25:10.720
chosen why don't you don't become Jews

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.360
why don't you convert well the answer is

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.880
and let's play the rest of the answer is

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.399
coming have a listen they are the Bible

00:25:16.399 --> 00:25:19.600
says the apple of God's eye the apple is

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.000
the pupil of your eye so if you start

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.159
picking on Israel you're sticking your

00:25:25.159 --> 00:25:28.559
finger in the eye of God try sticking

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:30.919
your finger in someone's eye and see how

00:25:30.919 --> 00:25:33.440
quick you get their attention or stick

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.000
your finger somewhere else did you

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.760
notice the very smart conflation from

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.520
God's chosen people and the Jewish

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.360
people and as a Muslim I believe God

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.039
does cherish the Jewish people but did

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:44.960
you notice the smart conflation from

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.640
that to Israel immediately what hag's

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.559
interest is not the Jewish people it's

00:25:49.559 --> 00:25:51.080
the state of Israel which is a modern

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.640
secular creation when God is talking in

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.840
the Bible about Jews and Israel he's not

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:54.960
talking about the state created by David

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.720
muron in 1948 um let's keep playing the

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.960
significant thing for you to remember

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.039
here is that God Almighty is making it

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:07.520
an unbreakable Covenant with Abraham

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.080
Isaac and Jacob forever that the land

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.320
belongs to the Jewish people end of

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.320
story there are 38 different passages in

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.640
the Bible that give the borders of

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.360
Israel God promised the Jewish

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.279
people these lands one/ half of modern

00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:31.600
day Egypt all of Israel all of Lebanon

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.360
all of Syria all of Jordan all of Kuwait

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.880
and 34s of Saudi Arabia this is going to

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.840
become a reality in the millennial Reign

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.360
when Jesus Christ Ru the world from

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.559
Jerusalem with a rod of iron God's not

00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:50.520
saying let's make a deal he's saying

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.000
this is the deal this is the property

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.360
they have this is Israel right

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.760
now and this is what will happen

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.200
whenever the Messiah comes back it will

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.799
be a massive land grant it's very

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:08.200
interesting because this is also very

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.000
close to the map of Greater Israel that

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.520
smish and benir put it behind them but

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.320
they their map is much bigger so here

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.440
likei basically gave them a little bit

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.559
of Saudi Arabia all of Syria all of Le

00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:22.159
all

00:27:22.159 --> 00:27:24.559
of about your country yeah but a little

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:26.279
bit here but like in the greater Israel

00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:30.039
they take all of Sinai all the way

00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:33.240
turkey and the thing is and and he says

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.480
like sooner or later this happen so

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.399
basically we are being told that we are

00:27:38.399 --> 00:27:40.399
going to be kicked out of our Our Land

00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:43.320
soon because God wants that so that's

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.039
scary right I mean this is this is and

00:27:45.039 --> 00:27:46.720
this is not again Fringe figure 90 to

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.159
100 million evangelicals in the United

00:27:48.159 --> 00:27:49.720
States John hag's one of the biggest

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.480
figures he's invited to White House

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.000
events he's invited to US Embassy

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.480
openings imagine if a Muslim was saying

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.600
this stuff if imagine if a Muslim says

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.399
it's like we to destroy Israel and then

00:27:59.399 --> 00:28:01.799
the next day and the next day he's like

00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:03.480
he's hosted by the president of Egypt

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.320
imagine a college kid on campus is

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.600
saying from The River To The Sea

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.000
Palestine will be free we're told that's

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.240
genocide this guy is proposing wiping

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.039
out multiple countries in the Middle

00:28:12.039 --> 00:28:14.000
East he's a favorite of the Republican

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.200
party and by the way this is the most

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.519
important point he's an anti-semite yeah

00:28:18.519 --> 00:28:20.559
it's open antiem his philosemitism he

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:22.039
the thing about those people Kies and

00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:24.480
the likes they are pro-israel but they

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.360
hate the Jews because the they're pro

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.840
Israel because they want to get

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.320
go there so we can kill you just to be

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.960
clear John haggy is on the record saying

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.039
that Hitler was a half Jew he says the

00:28:37.039 --> 00:28:39.360
Antichrist will be partially Jewish this

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.279
phrase that I'm using in scripture the

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:43.559
god of his fathers is a phrase in

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:46.000
scripture used solely to identify the

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.080
Jewish people it suggests that this man

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.399
is at least going to be partially Jewish

00:28:51.399 --> 00:28:53.399
as was out of Hitler Pastor I'm pretty

00:28:53.399 --> 00:28:55.080
sure if you and I God forbid ever said

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.880
anything close to that we would be

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.480
rightly

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.039
canell this guy is hosted by the

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:02.519
Republican Party by United States

00:29:02.519 --> 00:29:04.279
presidents and he's supposed to be the

00:29:04.279 --> 00:29:05.760
Ally of the Jewish people what what's

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.720
your name stepanic what's El stepanic

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.399
the one who's like grilling all the ivy

00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:14.080
league presidents she goes in and she

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.279
endorses car paladon who said that

00:29:16.279 --> 00:29:17.720
Hitler is the kind of leader that we

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.120
need today I was thinking the other day

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.039
about somebody had mentioned on radio

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:26.640
Adolf Hitler and and how he aroused the

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.360
crowds I mean get up there screaming

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.679
these epitet and and and these people

00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:34.720
were just they they were hypnotized by

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.320
them uh that's I guess I guess that's

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.760
the kind of uh leader we need today she

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.399
also endorses great replacement Theory

00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:43.679
which led to the killings in Buffalo

00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:45.240
which says Jews are bringing in brown

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.080
people so so the same people who love

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.919
Israel are the same people who go out

00:29:48.919 --> 00:29:51.279
and say Jews will not replace us it's

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:54.679
scary it is scary and they see that like

00:29:54.679 --> 00:29:56.360
I'm watching hold hold on they do I just

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.320
want to be clear here okay our American

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.799
Jewish Community does see that right so

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:01.480
the polling done by Pew and others shows

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.080
here's a great stat for you twice as

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.720
many Christian evangelicals believe God

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.679
gave the land to the Jewish people in

00:30:08.679 --> 00:30:11.600
America as American Jews yeah it's a 2

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.279
to1 ratio right it's crazy like 60 to 7%

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:15.559
of American even believe God gave that

00:30:15.559 --> 00:30:17.279
land to the Jewish people for them alone

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:18.840
only about 30 to 40% of American Jews

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.799
believe that literal vision of the so

00:30:20.799 --> 00:30:22.880
the naftali Bennett Vision so again we

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.039
have to remind ourselves we're not

00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:25.159
talking about ordinary Jews and

00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:26.240
Christians here we're talking about

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.679
Fringe freaks who are no longer fringes

00:30:28.679 --> 00:30:30.519
in their respective countries in Israel

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:32.000
they're controlling the government and

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.240
in the United States they're controlling

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.039
the Republican party people like Robert

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:37.480
jeffris who says stuff like Jews will go

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.600
to hell he was invited to the US Embassy

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.320
opening where Jonathan greenblat from

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.720
the ADL spoke alongside him didn't call

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.440
him an anti-semite but calls Rashida T

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.000
and others so it's deeply depressing to

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.120
see what is happening in the United

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.640
States and again why are we talking

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.320
about this now because as you said leaan

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.640
is holding Congressional hearings into

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.360
college students you Mike Johnson the

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.240
Speaker of the House you want and you

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.320
know the guy Rick Allen do you know a

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.799
congressman called wa wait we have a

00:30:58.799 --> 00:31:00.679
clip Rick Allan can I see the CLI can we

00:31:00.679 --> 00:31:01.960
we have a clip from a college hearing

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.320
let's look have a look at this college

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.720
he and then then you'll know why basam

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.159
and I decided to talk about this subject

00:31:06.159 --> 00:31:09.519
today are you familiar with Genesis 12:3

00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:11.840
probably not as well as you are

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.120
Congressman well it's pretty clear it

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.000
was a

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.159
covenant that God made with

00:31:19.159 --> 00:31:22.519
Abraham and uh that Covenant was real

00:31:22.519 --> 00:31:25.840
clear uh if you bless Israel I will

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.679
bless you if you curse Israel is I will

00:31:28.679 --> 00:31:31.279
curse you and then in the New

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:34.000
Testament it was confirmed that all

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.720
nations would be

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:40.600
blessed through you so you you do not

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.480
know about that I have heard that now

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.200
that you've explained it yes I heard

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.519
that before it's now familiar uh do you

00:31:47.519 --> 00:31:50.720
consider that a serious issue I mean do

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.600
you want Columbia University to be

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.600
cursed by God of the

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.279
Bible definitely not I mean maybe you

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:01.799
should have a course and you know you

00:32:01.799 --> 00:32:03.919
don't have to believe it but you know

00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:07.639
the Bible is an Incredible Book there's

00:32:07.639 --> 00:32:09.679
a lot of history there and you don't

00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:11.600
have to believe it but you need to know

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.519
what's in there maybe you should have a

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:16.279
course suggested for those who are

00:32:16.279 --> 00:32:19.360
having problems with all of this uh on

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.039
the Bible and what's in the Bible and

00:32:22.039 --> 00:32:25.200
kind of what will happen if you know

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.440
under the wrath of God no here's the

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.639
here's the thing

00:32:28.639 --> 00:32:31.559
Genesis 123 does not read like that yeah

00:32:31.559 --> 00:32:35.639
Genesis 123 is like uh is God talking to

00:32:35.639 --> 00:32:38.480
Abraham and he's telling them if I bless

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.840
people who bless you and I curse people

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.919
who curse you he's talking to Abraham

00:32:41.919 --> 00:32:43.120
he's not talking to Israel he's not

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.080
talking to David Ben he not he's talking

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.480
about abah Benjamin and people might ask

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.559
yeah but like Israel Jewish people are

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:52.799
descends from Abraham so as Arabs so the

00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:56.600
whole but but let's say he was no but

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.639
here AG with you there because there's

00:32:58.639 --> 00:33:00.639
like multiple mistakes here first of all

00:33:00.639 --> 00:33:03.159
he's quoting religious scripture in

00:33:03.159 --> 00:33:05.039
order in in a political setting second

00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:09.080
of all it's a distorted translation and

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.039
and and a lot of and again when I talked

00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:12.279
about this a lot of people said bessim

00:33:12.279 --> 00:33:14.000
you're meddling into the French thing

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.480
but a lot of people don't talk about the

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.120
Scofield bible the scoffield Bible which

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:23.799
was written 1909 1909 by an ex-felon and

00:33:23.799 --> 00:33:25.240
and and and he with no religious

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.880
training which reminds me of the

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.440
islamists a lot of the islamist leaders

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.080
like zairi have no religious training I

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.559
notice similarity but I don't know if

00:33:31.559 --> 00:33:33.240
you heard this but you say like the the

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.880
the the Christian Bible is read from

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.720
left to right the Hebrew Bible is read

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.720
from right to left and the scoffield

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.039
Bible is read from down upwards because

00:33:43.039 --> 00:33:46.000
the notes the subn notes the footnotes

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.039
controls everything they have made an

00:33:48.039 --> 00:33:50.679
interet and here's the thing that Bible

00:33:50.679 --> 00:33:53.760
and the footnotes was changed many times

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.720
especially after 1967 the 6 days war in

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.159
the80s I believe they it all about

00:33:58.159 --> 00:34:00.080
antisemitism is and and the whole idea

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.960
about like there's no crime more than

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.000
anti all of that is not in the Bible

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.039
just just to the people listening in

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:06.600
case you think what the hell basman May

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.599
talking about random FR stuff this is

00:34:08.599 --> 00:34:11.000
the Bible that inspires John haggy H Hal

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.280
Lindsay all of these end times guys who

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.199
unfortunately are in many ways

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.079
brainwashing millions of Americans about

00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:19.320
this clip Rick Allen is a congressman

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.119
from Georgia right the congressman from

00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:22.918
Georgia by the way the craziest ones Mar

00:34:22.918 --> 00:34:24.320
Taylor green is from Georgia right some

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.239
of the craziest Republicans from Georgia

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.679
how does Manish shafik the president

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.839
presid of Columbia sit there and laugh

00:34:29.839 --> 00:34:32.159
and smile and go yes I would have said

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:34.079
what the hell are you talking about

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:35.480
she's busy calling the police in to

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.719
clear she's scared for her job and I

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:39.679
think is and I think is like even after

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:41.960
all of the concessions she gave to them

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.839
she she

00:34:42.839 --> 00:34:45.599
still stay stay still with Biden after

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:47.119
all the concession he gave to Israel

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:49.800
Biden does not withand with Biden here's

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.079
what's so fascinating about this clip

00:34:51.079 --> 00:34:53.079
again can you I hate the imagin if game

00:34:53.079 --> 00:34:54.280
but I'm going to play it can you imagine

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.760
if ilhan Omar was interviewing a college

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.960
President and said but the says do you

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.680
want to go against the Go I mean can you

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.079
imagine people would lose their mind

00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:04.200
this guy's not even a household name

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.440
nobody knows who Rick Allen he should be

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.680
on the front page of every newspaper as

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.880
a deranged religious theocrat in

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.880
Congress bullying secular College

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.119
presidents and this is what's happening

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:14.839
in our politics the Republican party is

00:35:14.839 --> 00:35:17.320
not just white supremacist adjacent it

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.040
is fullon Christian supremacist even

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.160
secular folks Lindsey Graham Lindsey

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.520
Graham who's not known as some Christian

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.560
theocrat did you hear what he said at

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.359
the beginning oh he want to like new

00:35:26.359 --> 00:35:27.760
Gaza or something he wanted to level Gaz

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.000
but listen to the context in which said

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:29.960
I think we have the clip of Lindsey

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.599
Graham Senator uh Republican senator

00:35:32.599 --> 00:35:34.599
we're in a religious War here I am with

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:36.560
Israel do whatever the hell you have to

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.760
do to defend yourself level the place F

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.079
from The River To The Sea Palestine will

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:42.160
be free according to the House of

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.280
Representatives in a resolution is is a

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.960
genocidal statement but a Republican

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.359
senator saying level the place and I

00:35:47.359 --> 00:35:50.040
think in the same in the same or he said

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.160
like oh we knew Kish and they should do

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.400
what this an old clip he said that the

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.000
other day this is straight after like

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.359
people like him people like openly

00:35:59.359 --> 00:36:01.640
atheist Bill Mars they are like atheist

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.079
until it comes to Israel Suddenly It's

00:36:03.079 --> 00:36:05.000
biblical oh we are the chosen people is

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.800
not known for being a very Christian you

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.119
know right-wing member of Congress but

00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:09.560
the story he says this is a religious

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.480
War basam this is what bothers me most

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.680
about this debate this is what this is I

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.599
actually want to talk about some of the

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:15.560
French freaks today because I don't

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.760
believe it's a religious War I assume

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.960
you don't believe it's a religious War

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:20.920
it's not made into a religious war look

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.480
as as as people like Rashid khi and Omar

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.599
bagti of BDS have said we would oppose

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:27.760
zionists if they were Buddhists if they

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.440
were Hindus if what if they were

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.839
atheists right it's a war about land

00:36:31.839 --> 00:36:33.760
it's a it's a struggle about freedom and

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.319
self-determination it's not about

00:36:35.319 --> 00:36:36.800
religion I would support the Palestinian

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.200
people I support the people of Tibet

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.640
they're not Muslim I support their right

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.240
to self-determination I support the weas

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.319
and shinjang who are Muslim I support

00:36:43.319 --> 00:36:44.880
Palestinians who are Christians and

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.680
Muslims for people like Lindsey Graham

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.280
to say this is a religious war is so

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.240
reckless and dangerous and irresponsible

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.920
yeah and I think is people tell you what

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.000
about the people on the Islams like we

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.560
already call them terrorist exactly we

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.119
already call them terorist if you want

00:36:58.119 --> 00:37:00.480
to make the comparison and none of them

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.720
is in the heads of states of the country

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.560
surrounding Israel Egypt even Saudi

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.359
Arabia one of the the most Rel religious

00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:11.480
MBS will never he locked up all the

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.880
Islamic preachers he he will not have

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.760
people coming on like representing Saudi

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.520
Arabia and say like oh it's a relig so

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.400
we should wipe up the Jews and we have a

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:22.160
lot of Jews in religious scripture to

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.800
advance that but also when Hamas says

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.160
stuff like that and Hamas calls itself

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.800
Islamic resistance movement people don't

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.839
agree with that right that's the whole

00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:29.640
point Palestinians are led by quote

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.800
unquote uh you know the pa the palestin

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.359
authority the PLO which have always been

00:37:33.359 --> 00:37:36.200
secular organizations this is a struggle

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.400
for Freedom it's very simple and for

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:39.760
people like Graham to make it into a

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.880
religious war and for people like Mike

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.240
Johnson to turn up at events where

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.319
they're talking about rebuilding temples

00:37:45.319 --> 00:37:48.520
wiping out mosques burning out red cows

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.160
it is scary I'm sorry to say and that's

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.839
why I wanted to talk about it today and

00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:53.400
and it is crazy it's like a lot of

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.560
projection a lot of deflection because

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.800
now it's like you know I'm all for

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.160
criticizing extreme religious views

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.079
whether that was Islamic or otherwise

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:03.520
but now I think it's I think the table

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.000
has turned I think we need to talk about

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.920
other religious extreme religious views

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.280
not just like Muslim people I don't know

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.839
about you but I've always been someone

00:38:09.839 --> 00:38:12.319
who I got in trouble with f I'm I'm a

00:38:12.319 --> 00:38:13.720
islamist hate

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.119
me Islam is freaking hate me I'm I'm a

00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:18.400
Muslim right I'm a Muslim I'm a

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.880
practicing Muslim I believe in Muslim I

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:22.079
believe in Islam but I don't believe

00:38:22.079 --> 00:38:24.359
that you weaponize religion I do believe

00:38:24.359 --> 00:38:26.640
that you have to have a space uh where

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.920
people are as you said earlier in the

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.599
show you can't impose your religious

00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:30.800
views on other people that's what it

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.200
comes and but it doesn't matter how many

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:33.240
times you say they're still going to

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.680
call you a terrorist Islam islamist and

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.200
then they would ignore all of that right

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.880
there in front of you in plain sight

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.640
which is crazy no the people I'm the

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.800
people who are trying to bring about the

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.960
end of the world on our side of the

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.119
argument thankfully don't have much

00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:49.119
power you can talk about Iran or Hamas

00:38:49.119 --> 00:38:50.319
whatever it is and Iran doesn't have

00:38:50.319 --> 00:38:52.079
nuclear weapons Israel does and America

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:53.680
does and Israel has the backing of the

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.800
United States but if you want to talk

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.359
like there is a clip there is a clip

00:38:58.359 --> 00:39:00.000
that I there's like a religious like

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.599
Jewish leader who's talking about like

00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:03.319
killing everybody I wrote about him for

00:39:03.319 --> 00:39:07.440
Z Rabbi eliahu Mali from

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.280
yafa and in reality do not spare any

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.480
soul is based on the doctrine that says

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.760
he who comes to kill you in the

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.800
afternoon kill him in the morning and

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.440
the one who comes to kill you here in

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.280
the broad sense is not the person who

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.400
was 18 16 20 30 years old the one who

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.920
points his weapon at

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:26.640
you but also the Next Generation and

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.000
those who give birth to the Next

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.200
Generation because in reality there is

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.880
no

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.319
difference and elderly people the

00:39:34.319 --> 00:39:36.599
elderly people there is no such thing

00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:38.480
called an innocent creature by the way

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.440
the elderly man is capable of carrying a

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.000
rifle and

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.520
shooting therefore the Torah concept is

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.280
very clear in the

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.920
ruling in Gaza according to estimates

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.400
from the IDF between 95% to 98% want to

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.040
annihilate us this is the silent

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.960
majority

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.040
the children too should be killed the

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.040
same thing the same

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.720
thing when the Torah says do not spare

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.680
any Soul then you must not spare any

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.200
soul today he is a child today he is a

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.520
youth and tomorrow a fighter but this

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.960
guy this Rabbi interesting notice what

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.560
he says he says Don't Be Clever with the

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.880
Torah again the misuse of religion and

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.720
religious scripture is so blatant I

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.960
watch this I feel like I've gone back in

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.680
time to 20 years when you and I being us

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.680
condemn this shikh on YouTube condemn

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.280
this preacher in egyp why they condemn

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.839
this this guy if you put him in Arabic

00:40:26.839 --> 00:40:29.280
could fit with all of the Isis Al-Qaeda

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.119
folks he's saying kill kids and I wrote

00:40:31.119 --> 00:40:33.359
about him in my newsletter for Zeto

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:35.040
Shameless plug if you're not subscribed

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.359
to my newsletter it's z.com please do so

00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:38.599
no one else wrote about him he should be

00:40:38.599 --> 00:40:40.319
front page news if this was a and he's

00:40:40.319 --> 00:40:43.280
not some Fringe freak again B he trains

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.720
the soldiers going into Gaza their

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.920
students at his school many of the

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.680
officers going into Gaza are hearing

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:50.920
this crap in the name of religion I'm

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.599
always going to condemn anyone who kills

00:40:52.599 --> 00:40:54.520
in the name of Christianity anyone who

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.960
kills in the name of Judaism anyone who

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.319
kills in the name of Islam you don't

00:40:57.319 --> 00:40:59.119
don't use religion to justify your

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:01.440
craziness your violence your desire for

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.319
land I don't condemn I just make fun of

00:41:03.319 --> 00:41:05.560
them and I think we should have the

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.119
Liberty to call out all of those

00:41:08.119 --> 00:41:10.079
religious I mean I'm I'm not very

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:11.319
popular with the islamist mov and you

00:41:11.319 --> 00:41:13.280
know that people like don't like because

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.640
I I I you don't bring 7th Century

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.079
ideology into the 21st century but those

00:41:19.079 --> 00:41:21.760
people they're bringing like even like

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.359
predates Jesus Christ ideology they're

00:41:24.359 --> 00:41:26.599
bringing Gad been there for 6,000 years

00:41:26.599 --> 00:41:28.800
and their weapon in it in order to take

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.480
people land to kill people to have

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.720
license of killing children it's it's

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.240
the weaponizing that I have an issue

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.960
with right I have no problem with the

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.599
Book of Numbers I have no problem with

00:41:37.599 --> 00:41:39.440
religious sacrifices I have a great

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.880
sacrifice on edel Ada coming up I'm

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.319
looking forward to that meat but I know

00:41:42.319 --> 00:41:44.920
you're plant-based but um what I have a

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.960
problem with is the weaponization and I

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.480
think those of us who are in a position

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.960
to talk about this stuff should be able

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.560
to condemn this weaponization and make

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.839
more people aware of just the insanity

00:41:53.839 --> 00:41:55.160
because this is what we've talked about

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:56.920
today is not the majority opinion in any

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.599
of our communities I just feel we're in

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:02.200
a moment now basam where I spent the

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.839
last two decades as a journalist in the

00:42:03.839 --> 00:42:07.000
UK and the us being asked to condemn

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.520
Islamic extremism islamism jihadism

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.640
being told that Muslims are all crazy

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.079
extreme want to bring about the end of

00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:15.200
the world and now I'm sitting here in

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.680
the United States and I'm watching some

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.160
crazy Christian evangelicals some

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.160
militant far-right Israeli settlers form

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.520
this alliance with support in Congress

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.920
to do some really really dangerous stuff

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.240
which is flying below the radar and

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.240
that's why I wanted to talk about this

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.240
today you know we can laugh about a red

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.960
heer we can laugh about you know there's

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.800
prophecies about uh we didn't get time

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.240
to get into it there's prophecies about

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.079
Israel will only survive 80 years a lot

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:41.240
of Israeli Prime Ministers have warned

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.200
about this Netanyahu and Barack and

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:46.359
naftali Bennett a lot of that is driving

00:42:46.359 --> 00:42:47.599
what is going on in the Middle East as

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:48.880
you say the conflict is not about

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.400
religion but it's being made into

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.960
something that is about religion and I

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.960
think those of us whether we're Muslim

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.920
Christian Jewish atheist we shouldn't

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.000
have a billar pales exception we should

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.079
call out the extremism wherever we see

00:43:00.079 --> 00:43:02.119
it yeah if if the if the speaker of the

00:43:02.119 --> 00:43:05.240
house and and if again I I I talk this a

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.119
lot I talk about the the wait praying

00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:10.240
for Armageddon but they are now not just

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.960
like in the congress not in the sener

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.680
they are actually in the American Army

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:15.200
John haggy who we've talked about today

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.960
the head of cons Christians United for

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.200
Israel very influential Pastor who we

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.880
watched he says that he helped Donald

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.400
Trump persuade Donald Trump at a dinner

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.480
to move the embassy to Jerusalem the US

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.319
Embassy because he told him Jesus Will

00:43:28.319 --> 00:43:29.640
Rule from there for a thousand years now

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.680
Donald Trump doesn't believe in any of

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:31.680
this stuff Donald Trump only believes in

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.359
himself but the idea that they can shift

00:43:34.359 --> 00:43:36.319
political power in this way using these

00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:38.480
kind of fake religious justifications

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.000
and with Trump coming back very soon

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.839
into office is very worrying and I think

00:43:41.839 --> 00:43:43.079
we should end it when we start talking
